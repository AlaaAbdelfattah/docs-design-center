Dependencies are connectors and other parts of a flow that are versioned independently from the Mule runtime. You can update an existing project to use a different version of a dependency without losing its configuration. However, if the change to the version affects configuration fields, you might need to change those settings as described in the release notes.

== Procedure

. Click the Dependencies icon: image:manage-dependency-versions-design-center-d96c7.png[]

+
*Result:* A list of all project dependencies appears.

. Hover over a dependency and click the options icon: image:manage-dependency-versions-design-center-018a5.png[]
. Select *Change Version* and select the version.

== What to do next

Test the application with the new version until the application runs as expected.
