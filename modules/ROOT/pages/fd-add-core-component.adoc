You can add cards that represent core components to a flow if 

xref:reference-flow-task-design-center.adoc[Reference One Flow from Another with Flowref]:: By placing a Flow Ref core component in a flow, you can execute one flow from another within the same application.

xref:error-handling-task-design-center.adoc[Handle Errors with Try]:: You can put specific parts of a flow that are prone to errors inside Try. If an attempt to use the part of the flow in Try fails, Try can catch the errors and apply a fix or an alternative.

xref:logger-task-design-center.adoc[Log Data with Logger]:: You add one or more Logger core components to a flow to log information from the flow at runtime.
