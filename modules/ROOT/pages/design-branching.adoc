By default, the projects that you work on in API Designer's text editor are saved in Design Center. Projects saved in this location are not accessible outside of API Designer. Only other users in your Anypoint Platform business organization can edit such projects.

When you store a project in Design Center, the project is saved to the branch `master` by default. You can create forks of the project if you do not want to change the content that is in the `master` branch. Forks do not become independent projects. To access a fork, you must open the project that you created the fork within.

You can use all of the text editor's features with a fork, including publishing the fork to Anypoint Exchange. However, you cannot merge forks back into the original project that is in the `master` branch.

Even when there are forks of a project, when you open that project the editor opens it to the master branch. If you want to return to a fork that you were working in, you must select that fork.

To see which location you are currently working in, look just above the central pane of the text editor. Click the down arrow to switch to a fork or to the `master` branch, or to create a fork.

.The name of the project and the location in which you are currently saving your work appear above the central pane.
