A _connection_ is a saved set of information that a running Mule app must use to connect to a specific system by means of a connector. You might create a connection as part of adding a connector to a flow.

.This flowchart shows steps for adding a connector to a Mule-app project. Creating a connection can be one of those steps.

<1> When you add a connector to a flow, you create a _configuration_, which is a set of information that includes a connection. If a configuration exists that you can use, then you can simply select it. However, if no configuration exists yet for the connector, or if no existing configuration fits your use case, then you must create a configuration.
<2> Part of creating a configuration is specifying which connection the connector must use to connect to a system when your Mule app is running.
<3> When the dialog for creating a configuration is opened, it presents a list of connections, if any connections already exist for this type of connector. The dialog also enables you to create a connection. For example, if you are adding a Database connector, Flow Designer opens the *Database Configuration* dialog. This dialog presents a list of connections to databases, if any connections already exist for this type of connector. The dialog also enables you to create a connection to a database.
<4> In the procedure explained in the next section, you click the *Add connection* button to create a connection. Afterward, you return to the configuration dialog for the connector.

A part of the configuration dialog that presents options about connections looks like this:

.Part of the *Database Configuration* dialog presents a list of connections to databases and an option for creating a connection to a database.

<1> Each existing connection shows roughly when the connection was created and the user ID of the person who created it.
<2> The *Add connection* option lets you create a connection.



== Procedure

. Click *Add connection* in the configuration dialog for a connector that you have added to a flow.
. Give the connection a descriptive name.
. If you want the connection to be available to yourself and others in your business group for use in other projects, select the *Share this connection with my business group* checkbox.
. Select the type of connection that you are creating. For help with the fields, see the documentation for the connector that you are adding to your Mule-app project.
. Click *Save*.

== Result

Flow Designer returns you to the configuration dialog for the connector. Click *Save* to return to the canvas.
