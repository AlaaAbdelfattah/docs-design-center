When you want to share your API specification with other developers, you can publish it to Anypoint Exchange. Exchange creates a page that presents the project for anyone in your business group to view and download the project from.

.The page that Exchange creates for a published project includes a left pane for viewing the specification's documentation, a middle pane for viewing a description of the specification, and a right pane for viewing metadata about the specification.

<1> The left pane, which you can navigate to view the documentation. The navigation is generated from the documentation in the specification.
<2> The middle pane, which describes the specification. You write the description in Exchange after publishing the specification.
<3> The right pane, which displays metadata about the specification.

== Procedure

. Open the API-specification project that you want to publish, if it is not already open.
. In the top-right corner of API Designer, click *Publish* and then click *Publish to Exchange*.

<1> *Asset version*: The version number to be displayed in the *Version* section of the page that Anypoint Exchange creates for the project.
<2> *API version*: The version number of the API specification. For a description of this field, see the next section.
<3> *Business group ID*: The ID of the business unit in Anypoint Platform to which the project belongs.
<4> *Asset name*: The name that Anypoint Exchange uses to identify the published project.
<5> *Asset ID*: The ID that Anypoint Exchange uses to identify the published project.
<6> *Add to API Manager*: Select this option if you want to publish the API specification to an API portal. When you click *Publish to Exchange*, API Designer also publishes the specification to API Manager, where the specification is listed in the *API Administration* section.

== The *API version* field

Anypoint Exchange requires that each API specification published to it have a version number.

This field is disabled if the version number of the API specification is provided in the specification. In specifications written in OAS, the `version` field is required. However, in specifications written in RAML, the `version` node is optional.

If the specification is written in RAML and the `version` node is not included in the specification, the *API version* field is enabled. You must specify a version number for the specification in this field before you can publish the specification.

<1> API Designer checks whether the version number for the API specification is provided within the specification. If the version number is provided, then the *API version* field is populated with the number and disabled, so that you cannot change the number. If the specification does not provide the version number, then API Designer moves to the next check.
<2> API Designer checks whether the check box *Add to API Manager* is selected. If the check box is selected, then API Designer prevents you from proceeding because API Manager requires that the specification provide the version number. If the check box is not selected, then API Designer moves to the last check.
<3> API Designer checks whether the specification is being published to Anypoint Exchange for the first time. If the specification is being published for the first time, then API Designer enables the *API version* field and suggests a version number because a number is not provided in the specification. If the specification is not being published for the first time, then API Designer enables the *API version* field and populates the field with the number used when the specification was last published. You can change the number.
