You can see a history of changes you make to a project in Flow Designer.
The saved states are listed by the ID of the user who made the change, time, date, and activity. The activity name is based on the action you performed at save time.

Being able to view a saved state of a project is useful if you want to:

* Undo an inadvertent change you made to a project and revert to the working state.
* Review changes made by other users on the project.
* Retrieve previous values of connector configurations.

== Procedure

To restore to a previous version:

. Click *History* on the upper left of the canvas to open the Project History list on the right of the canvas.
. Click a saved state from the list. The saved state is a read-only view of each card in the project flow on the canvas.
. Click on a card to view the configuration details of that object in the flow. Continue with this method to review any changes for a card or object in the flow.
. Once you decide upon and select a saved state and want to revert, click *Restore* at the top of the canvas. From the dialog that displays you have a choice to restore or cancel. Cancel returns you to the selected state.
. Click *Restore* to restore to the state you selected and return to the Project Canvas. The restored state is moved to the top of the history list.
