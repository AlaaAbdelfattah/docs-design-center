= Test Endpoints by Simulating Calls to Methods in the Code Editor

While you are creating an API specification, you can test the endpoints that you define by using the code editor to simulate calls to them. You can test whether required query parameters are defined as required or optional, the bodies of responses are correct, and more.

== General Procedure

. Turn on the mocking service.
. Open the documentation for the method that you want to the method that you want to simulate calls to.
. Click *Try It*.
. Fill in values for required parameters, if there are any.
. Select any options that you want to add to the simulation.
+
* Add optional query parameters to test whether these are defined correctly.
* Add optional headers (why? I mean headers other than the behavioral headers.)
* For methods that send a request body, modify the body to trigger an error status code.
. Click *Send*.
