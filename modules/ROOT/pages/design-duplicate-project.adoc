The dependencies in the original project are retained in the duplicate project.

Duplicating a project opens a new browser tab that displays the new project in the editor in which you opened the original project.

The project is listed in Design Center's project list.

If the original was in a sub-branch, then the duplicate is on the master branch.

You cannot duplicate a project when the mocking service is turned on.
You cannot duplicate a project that is in read-only mode.

To duplicate a project:

. Open the project.
. Click the gear in the top-right corner of the editor.
. Select *Duplicate*.
. Name the duplicate project and click *Duplicate*.
