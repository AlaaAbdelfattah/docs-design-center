As you write an API specification, you can document its endpoints and types, so that, after you publish the specification, other developers can learn about them. As you add your documentation, you can review it in the right panel of the code editor.

== Tour of the Documentation Pane

Let's have a look at the documentation for a complex RAML API specification. To view the documentation, you open the *Documentation* pane.

. The *Documentation* tab: click this to view the documentation for your specification.
. The content of the current page: the first time you click the *Documentation* tab, the summary of the API specification appears, as in this image. This summary page lists all of the API endpoints and their methods. Click the hyperlinks to go to the overview page for each endpoint. Click a colored box for a method to go to the page that documents the method.
. The entity overview: At the top of each page appears information about the entity (entire specification, endpoint, method, or type) that the page displays documentation for. In this image, the title and version of the API specification are displayed. In the dark gray box appears the base URI. The mocking service is on and the base URI for testing endpoints with the mocking service is displayed.
. The navigation icon: click this to display a table of contents that lets you navigate to the different pages of the documentation.

== The Table of Contents

The table of contents that appears contains three sections:
* *Summary*: Click this to go to the summary page of the specification.
* *Endpoints*: Expand this section to see a list of all of the endpoints that are defined in the specification. Expand an endpoint to see links to the endpoint's overview page and the documentation of the endpoint's methods.
* *Types*: Expand this section to a list of all of the types that are defined in the specification. Click a type to open its documentation.

After that is a list of the endpoints that the specification defines. When you expand the entry for an endpoint, the pane displays links to the overview page for the endpoint and to the documentation of the methods in the endpoint.

== Overviews for Endpoints

Click the overview page for an endpoint to see its description and a list of its methods. For each method, the *Documentation* pane shows the display name and description. Click the colored box for a method or its display name (if the method has one) to view the method's documentation.
At the bottom of the page are links to the previous and next endpoints in the table of contents.
