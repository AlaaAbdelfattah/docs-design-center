As you write an API specification, you can document its endpoints and types, so that, after you publish the specification, other developers can learn about them. As you add your documentation, you can review it in the right panel of the code editor.

== Tour of the Documentation Pane

Let's have a look at the documentation for a complex RAML API specification. To view the documentation, you open the *Documentation* pane.

.The *Documentation* pane in API Designer's code editor
image::apic-summary-page.png[]



. The *Documentation* tab: click this to view the documentation for your specification.
. The content of the current page: the first time you click the *Documentation* tab, the summary of the API specification appears, as in this image. This summary page lists all of the API endpoints and their methods. Click the hyperlinks to go to the overview page for each endpoint. Click a colored box for a method to go to the page that documents the method.
. The entity overview: At the top of each page appears information about the entity (entire specification, endpoint, method, or type) that the page displays documentation for. In this image, the title and version of the API specification are displayed. In the dark gray box appears the base URI. The mocking service is on and the base URI for testing endpoints with the mocking service is displayed.
. The navigation icon: click this to display a table of contents that lets you navigate to the different pages of the documentation.

== The Table of Contents

The table of contents that appears contains three sections:
* *Summary*: Click this to go to the summary page of the specification.
* *Endpoints*: Expand this section to see a list of all of the endpoints that are defined in the specification. Expand an endpoint to see links to the endpoint's overview page and the documentation of the endpoint's methods.
* *Types*: Expand this section to a list of all of the types that are defined in the specification. Click a type to open its documentation.

This image and the next one display the pane that appears when you click the navigation icon. At the top of the pane is a link to the summary page for the specification. After that is a list of the endpoints that the specification defines. When you expand the entry for an endpoint, the pane displays links to the overview page for the endpoint and to the documentation of the methods in the endpoint.

Scroll to the end of the *Endpoints* section or collapse it to see the *Types* section, which lists the types that the specification defines. Click a type to go directly to its documentation.

== Overviews for Endpoints

Click the overview page for an endpoint to see its description and a list of its methods. For each method, the *Documentation* pane shows the display name and description. Click the colored box for a method or its display name (if the method has one) to view the method's documentation.
At the bottom of the page are links to the previous and next endpoints in the table of contents.

== Documentation for Methods

a| image::apid-doc-full-panel-get-top.png[]
a| At the top of the documentation is the display name for the method, if the specification defines a display name for it. Next is the URI for accessing the endpoints. The URI is an extension of the base URI. The description of the method follows.

In the top-right corner of the documentation is the *Try It* button, which you can click if you want to test the method by simulating a call to it.

a| image::apid-doc-full-panel-get-codeex.png[]
a| The *Code examples* section provides samples that you can use in applications for sending requests to the method. Each sample uses the URI that appears at the top of the page.

a| image::apid-doc-full-panel-get-query-parms.png[]
a| The *Query parameters* section lists the parameters that you can add to the end of the request URI. If a parameter is required to be in the request URI, the abel `Required` appears in its description.

| The *Response* section displays the different responses that the specification defines for the method. In this image, the response for the 200 response code is visible. Clicking the 400 and 500 response codes to the left of the 200 response code would show the responses for those two codes.

{empty} +

For each response code, the body of the response is shown. The details include the media type, the name of the type being used for the response, an example of a response message, and descriptions of the elements that are allowed in the response. Elements that are required to be in the body are labelled `Required`.

{empty} +

If the specification does not define an example response, and if the specification defines a media type globally, then the *Documentation* pane generates an example response. The values in the example are all empty strings.

== Documentation for Types

[cols="<.<,<.<", width="100%", frame="none", grid="none"]

a| .The documentation of a type
image::apid-doc-type-full-panel.png[]
a| At the top of the documentation is the name of the type and its description, if the specification defines a description.

Next appears an example of the type. If the specification does not define an example, and if the specification defines a media type globally, then the *Documentation* pane generates an example. The values in the example are all empty strings.

After the example, the elements of the type are listed and described. Any elements that are required to be in the type are labelled `Required`.
