If your organization requires someone with the proper authority to deploy applications from Runtime Manager, you can share with that person a copy of your project as a JAR file to deploy your application with.

No sensitive connection information, such as usernames, passwords, and security tokens, is included in the exported
JAR file. Therefore, you must edit and repackage the JAR file to provide that information for every configuration that is used by a connector in the app.

== Steps to Follow in Flow Designer

. Ensure that the project is free of errors.
. Export your project by clicking the three dots in the top-right corner of the canvas and selecting *Export*.
+
.You can access the *Export* option from the top-right corner of the canvas.

<1> The three dots are to the right of the button that is labeled with a down arrow.
<2> The *Export* option is at the bottom of the menu.

. Select *Export mule application* and click *Export*.
+
A JAR file containing a copy of your Mule app is downloaded to the default location on your computer.

== Steps to Follow Before Importing the JAR File into Runtime Manager

. Extract the content of the JAR file.
. Open the file `src/main/resources/mule-artifact.properties` in the folder that was extracted from the JAR file, and provide values for the keys that are related to connection information.
+
The names of all keys for connection information contain three parts, the middle part being `connection`. You must provide values for all of these keys in the file. After saving the file, you can test and run the app.
+
For example, suppose that an instance of Salesforce Connector in an app uses a configuration that includes a *Basic Username Password* connection. For this type of connection, you must provide a username, password, and a security token. The username, password, and security token that are in the configuration that the connector uses when the app is in Flow Designer are not included in the configuration in the exported JAR file.
+
In the file `src/main/resources/mule-artifact.properties` are keys for the connection information for every configuration that is being used by a connector in the app. For the *Basic Username Password* connection in the configuration that the instance of Salesforce Connector is using in this example, these are the three keys:
+
----
salesforce.connection.password =
salesforce.connection.securityToken =
salesforce.connection.username=
----

. Save `src/main/resources/mule-artifact.properties`.

== Steps to Follow in Runtime Manager

. Switch to the CloudHub environment in which you want to deploy the app.
. Click *Deploy Application*.
. On the *Deploy Application* page, select *Choose File* > *Upload File* and upload the JAR file.
. Follow the instructions in https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/deploying-to-cloudhub.adoc[Deploying to CloudHub].
