A card in a flow might require the data that is sent to it to be in a certain format or to contain certain elements. For example, in the tutorial "xref::salesforce-to-twilio.adoc[Create Your First Mule Application with Flow Designer]", you needed to map the output of the Choice card to the input that was required by the NTO Order API.

To do the mapping, you used a Transform card, clicking and dragging elements from the *Input* side to elements on the *Output* side. (In the Transform card, "input" and "output" are terms that are relative to the Transform card itself. The "input" to the Transform card was the output of the Choice card, and the "output" of the Transform card was the input to the Order API.)

You had to do the mapping because the Order API (which was a REST API that you sent a POST message to) did not require all of the data that was in the output of the Choice card. Moreover, some of the elements of the data required by the API had names that differed from the corresponding elements in the Choice card's output
