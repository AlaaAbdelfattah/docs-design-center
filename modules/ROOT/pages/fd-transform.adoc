A card in a flow might require that the data that is sent to it be in a certain format or contain certain elements. In such a situation, that card expects a particular data type. You might have to map the output of the preceding card to that data type.

For example, suppose that a flow contains Card A and Card B, and that Card B follows Card A. If the output of Card A uses the same data type that Card B requires for its input, then you do not have to map the output of Card A to the input of Card B. However, if the two data types do not match, you must use a Transform card to map data from the output of Card A to the data type required by Card B.

.The output of Card A matches the input that Card B requires, so Card B can immediately follow Card A in the flow

.The output of Card A does not match the input that Card B requires; therefore, you must use a Transform card to map Card A's output to the input for Card B
