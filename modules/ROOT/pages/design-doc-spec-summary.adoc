If you are working in an API-specification project, the first time you click the *Documentation* tab, the summary of the API specification appears. This documentation also appears when you open the table of contents by clicking the navigation icon and then click the entry *Summary*.

The first indicator in this screenshot points to the navigation icon. Clicking this opens the table of contents, which the second indicator points to. Before you can see the navigation icon, you must click the *Documentation* tab, which the third indicator points to.

== Basic Information about a Specification

The top of the *Summary* page displays three items. As shown in the following screenshot, the first item is the title that is defined by the `title` node in the specification. The second item is the version that is defined by the `version` node.

The third item is one of two entries:

* If the mocking service is off, this field displays the base URI that is defined by the `baseUri` node in the specification.

* If the mocking service is on, this field displays the base URI that the mocking service generated and that you can use in tests of the endpoints in the specification. (In the specification, the mocking service comments out the original base URI and substitutes the generated one. When you turn the mocking service off, the generated base URI is removed and the original one is uncommented.)

If the mocking service is off and no base URI is defined, this field does not appear. In this screenshot, the fourth indicator shows that the mocking service is on.


== The List of Endpoints and Their Methods

The *API endpoints* section of the *Summary* page provides links to the overview page of each endpoint that is defined in the current specification. For each endpoint, this section displays the types of method that you can use to access the resource at the endpoint.

The first item is a generated heading. You do not need to add it to your specifications.

The second item is a generated list of the endpoints that are defined in the specification. You do not need to add this list to your specifications. You can click the name of an endpoint to open the documentation for that endpoint.

The third item is a colored block that represents a method for accessing an endpoint. You can click a colored block to open the documentation for the corresponding method. The blocks are colored automatically according to the types of method that they represent.
