If you are working in an API-specification project, the first time you click the *Documentation* tab, the summary of the API specification appears. This documentation also appears when you open the table of contents by clicking the navigation icon and then click the entry *Summary*.

.The annotations show the locations of the navigation icon, the table of contents, and the *Documentation* tab.

The first annotation points to the navigation icon. Clicking this opens the table of contents, which the second annotation points to. Before you can see the navigation icon, you must click the *Documentation* tab, which the third annotation points to.

== Basic Information about a Specification

The first item is the title that is defined by the `title` node in the specification. The second item is the version that is defined by the `version` node.

The third item is one of three entries:

* If the mocking service is off, this field displays the base URI that is defined by the `baseUri` node in the specification.

* If the mocking service is on, this field displays the base URI that the mocking service generated and that you can use in tests of the endpoints in the specification. (In the specification, the mocking service comments out the original base URI and substitutes the generated one. When you turn the mocking service off, the generated base URI is removed and the original one is uncommented.)

* If the mocking service is off and no base URI is defined, this field displays the message `Base URI not defined in the API file.'

== The List of Endpoints and Their Methods

<screenshot>

The first item is a generated heading. You do not need to add it to your specifications.

The second item is a generated list of the endpoints that are defined in the specification. You do not need to add this list to your specifications. You can click the name of an endpoint to open the documentation for that endpoint.

The third item is a colored block that represents a method for accessing an endpoint. You can click a colored block to open the documentation for the corresponding method.
