If you are working in an API-specification project, the first time you click the *Documentation* tab, the summary of the API specification appears. This documentation also appears when you open the table of contents by clicking the navigation icon (image:apid-nav-icon.png[title="Navigation icon"]) and then click the entry *Summary*.

*The Numbered Parts of the Image*

. The title that is defined by the `title` node in the specification.
. The version that is defined by the `version` node.
. One of three entries:
+
* If the mocking service is off, this field displays the base URI that is defined by the `baseUri` node in the specification.
* If the mocking service is on, this field displays the base URI that the mocking service generated and that you can use in tests of the endpoints in the specification.
* If the mocking service is off and no base URI is defined, this field displays the message `Base URI not defined in the API file.'
. The heading "API endpoints" is generated. You do not need to add it to your specifications.
. A generated list of the endpoints that are defined in the specification. You do not need to add this list to your specifications. You can click the name of an endpoint to open the documentation for that endpoint.
+
The list also displays in colored blocks the types of HTTP method that the specification defines for accessing each endpoint. You can click a method type to open the method's documentation.

If you are working in an API-fragment project, there is no *Summary* page for the fragment.
