* If the mocking service is off, this field displays the base URI that is defined by the `baseUri` facet in the specification.
* If the mocking service is on, this field displays the base URI that the mocking service generated and that you can use in tests of the endpoints in the specification.
* If the mocking service is off and no base URI is defined, this field displays the message `Base URI not defined in the API file.'
. This heading is auto-generated.
