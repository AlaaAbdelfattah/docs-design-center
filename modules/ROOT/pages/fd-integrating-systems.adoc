The purpose of creating a Mule application is to integrate different systems together in an automated workflow to achieve an outcome. For example, the Flow Designer template "Slack message to Twilio" integrates together both Slack and Twilio to send a text message whenever there is a new message in a particular Slack channel.

Flow Designer supports the integration of a large variety of systems, and supports multiple operations within each system. For example, the Slack connector supports these operations:

On New Message

Channels - Info
Channels - INvite
Channels - List
Channels - Rename
Channels - Set Purpose
Channels - Set Topic
Chat - Post Message
Chat - Update Message
Dialog - Open
File - Upload
Groups - Info
Groups - List
Groups - Rename
Groups - Set Purpose
Groups - Set Topic
IM - List
IM - Open
Unauthorize
User - Info
User - List

with each system represented by its own card.
