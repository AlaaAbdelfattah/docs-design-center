= Expression Editor

Whenever you need to configure a DataWeave expression, you can use the expression editor to dynamically and easily edit and compose DataWeave expressions.

When designing a flow in Design Center, every field from every card that takes a DataWeave expression features an expression editor. +
When the input of your card is known by Datasense, the expression editor displays a list of blocks for every value of your Mule event's payload and attributes. You can drag and drop these expression blocks into your expression field to compose different Dataweave expressions.

== Creating Expressions

The editor needs Datasense metadata to generate the payload and attributes suggestions.

Starting with a simple example, let's create a simple flow where your HTTP Listener receives a POST request with a JSON payload containing a person's first and last name. A payload like this:

[source,JSON,linenums]
----
{
	"firstName": "Thor",
	"lastName": "Oddinson"
}
----

When creating your HTTP Listener, you need to set up the output type of your card to this example.

. Create a new HTTP Listener trigger and go to the *Output* tab.
. Next to the *Data Type* drop-down menu, click *Add*.
.. In the *Name* field use Name_ as an identifier.
.. Select *JSON* from the *Format* drop-down menu.
.. Select *From Example* in the *Type* field and use the JSON sample above.

Now that you defined the output type of your trigger, Datasense can now understand your payload's structure so that the expression editor displays the proper blocks. +
For example, create a Logger card next to your HTTP Listener, and observe the right navigation bar:

The expression editor automatically picks up both your payload's values: `payload.firstName` and `payload.lastName`. +
You can, for example, log a greeting to your user typing _Hello_ and drag the *firstName* block next to it:

Additionally, you can drag and drop the *Custom Expression* block to use the function editor to create your expression.
