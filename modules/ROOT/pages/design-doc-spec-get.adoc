At the top of the documentation is the display name for the method, if the specification defines a display name for it. Next is the URI for accessing the endpoints. The URI is an extension of the base URI. The description of the method follows.

In the top-right corner of the documentation is the *Try It* button, which you can click if you want to test the method by simulating a call to it.

The numbered parts are:

. The display name of the method, defined in the `displayName` facet for the method. If the specification does not define a display name, this space is blank.
. The *Try It* button for sending a request to a simulation of the endpoint that the method is defined for. Clicking this button replaces the content of the pane with controls for modifying and sending a request and for receiving a response.
. The URI for sending requests to the endpoint. If the mocking service is on, the URI displayed is generated by the mocking service. Otherwise, the URI is the base URI defined in the specification, with the name of the endpoint appended to it.
. Auto-generated text that appears if the definition of the method uses one or more collections.
. The description that is specified in the method's `description` facet. You can write the description either in plain text or in GitHub-flavored Markdown.
. The *Code examples* section, which provides a sample command for `curl` for sending a request to the endpoint, as well as code that you can use to access the endpoint from JavaScript, Python, C, and Java applications.
. The *Query parameters* section, which lists both the required and optional parameters to include in requests.
. The *Response* section, which contains a section for each status code that the endpoint can return for the request.
. The previous endpoint in the table of contents and in the list of endpoints that is in the summary documentation of the specification, the next endpoint, or both.

== The *Code examples* section

The *Code examples* section provides a sample command for `curl` for sending a request to the endpoint, as well as code that you can use to send a request from JavaScript, Python, C, and Java applications. Each sample uses the URI that appears at the top of the documentation of the method.

For more information about this section, see xref:design-test-endpoints-multiple-tools.adoc[Test Endpoints with `curl`, `http`, or an Application].

== The *Query parameters* section

The *Query parameters* section for `GET` methods lists the parameters that you can include in a request.

.A typical listing for a query parameter

The numbered parts are:

. The name that is defined for the query parameter.
. The data type of the parameter. If the query parameter is required to be included in requests, the annotation `Required` appears next to the data type.
. The description that is given in the `description` facet for the query parameter.
. Auto-generated text that displays (for number types) the default value, the minimum value, and the maximum value.


== The *Responses* section

The *Response* section displays the response for each of the status codes that the API can return for calls to the HTTP method. For each status code, the body of the response is displayed. The details in each section include the media type of the response body, the name of the type being used for the response, an example of a response message, and descriptions of the types that are allowed in the response. Types that are required to be in the body are labelled `Required`.


=== The top of the *Response* section

.The top of the *Response* section

The numbered parts are:

1. The auto-generated title for this section.
2. The different status codes that the specification defines as possible responses to requests. Click a status code to view more information about it.
3. The description that is defined in the `description` facet for responses that use the selected status code. In this image, the description is for responses that use status code 200.

=== The *Body* section

.The *Body* subsection of the *Response* section, showing the media type, the type defined for the response, the description of the type, and the example defined for the type.
image::apid-doc-get-overview-response-body.png[]

The numbered parts are:

1. The auto-generated title of the section.
2. The media type of the response body for the selected status code.
3. The name of the type that is used as the response body.
4. The description that is given in the `description` facet for the type.
5. The example that is defined for the type. If the specification does not define an example and if the media type for examples is defined globally in the specification, then an example is generated. The values in generated examples are empty strings.


include::partial$doc-for-some-body-types.adoc[]

.Documentation for some of the types that are in the body.
image::apid-doc-get-overview-response-body-types.png[]

The numbered parts are:

. The name of the type.
. The data type of the type.
. The description that is defined in the `description` facet for the type.
. An auto-generated indicator that appears when the specification defines the type as required.
. Examples that are defined for the type. If the specification does not define an example and if the media type for examples is defined globally in the specification, then an example is generated. For the type `item.paymentMethodType` in the image, two examples would be generated. The values in generated examples are empty strings.
. A line with auto-generated text -- `Any of:` --and that shows which types are allowed in a union type.
. An auto-generated indicator that appears when a type is an `enum`.
. A line with auto-generated text -- `Enum values` -- and that shows the permitted values for an enum.
