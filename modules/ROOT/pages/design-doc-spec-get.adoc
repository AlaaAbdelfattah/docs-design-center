At the top of the documentation is the display name for the method, if the specification defines a display name for it. Next is the URI for accessing the endpoints. The URI is an extension of the base URI. The description of the method follows.

In the top-right corner of the documentation is the *Try It* button, which you can click if you want to test the method by simulating a call to it.

The numbered parts are:

. The name that is defined for the query parameter.
. The data type of the parameter. If the query parameter is required to be included in requests, the annotation `Required` appears next to the data type.
. The description that is given in the `description` facet for the query parameter.
. Auto-generated text that displays (for number types) the default value, the minimum value, and the maximum value.


== The *Response* Section

The *Response* section displays the response for each of the status codes that the API can return for calls to the HTTP method. For each status code, the body of the response is displayed. The details in each section include the media type of the response body, the name of the type being used for the response, an example of a response message, and descriptions of the types that are allowed in the response. Types that are required to be in the body are labelled `Required`.
