In Design Center, you can design and create API specifications both in RAML and OAS. You can use either a visual editor, in which you fill in fields while the editor writes the actual specification, or an editor that is more traditional, but includes a number of features for drafting and testing. See xref:design-create-publish-api-specs.adoc[Create an API Specification or API Fragment].

You can also design and create Mule apps, which are automated workflows that are either scheduled or are triggered, and that span multiple systems, services, databases, and applications. See xref:about-designing-a-mule-application.adoc[Automate a Workflow].
