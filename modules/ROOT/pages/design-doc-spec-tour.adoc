The *Documentation* pane presents the content of an API specification or fragment in structured display that includes the documentation that you write in `description` and `documentation` facets, and that also includes autogenerated text. The structure of the display is the same for both specs in RAML and specs in OAS.

The numbered parts are:

. The *Documentation* tab: click this to open the *Documentation* pane and to view the documentation for your specification or fragment.
. The display of information about the currently selected item in the specification: This image shows the summary page for the specification that is in the code editor. However, there are several different types of documentation that can appear in this location, depending on the item that you select in the table of contents.
 ** For an entire specification, the list of all of the endpoints in the specification and the methods for accessing them.
 ** For an endpoint, the URI for accessing it (using the base URI that is defined in the specification), a description of the endpoint (if the specification defines one), and a list of the HTTP methods that can access the endpoint.
 ** For an HTTP method, the URI for sending requests (using the base URI that is defined in the specification), a description of the method (if the specification defines one), and other information, depending on the type of method. For example, for GET methods there is a list of query parameters, while for DELETE methods there is a list of URI parameters. For all methods, the different responses defined in the specification are displayed.
 ** For types, their names, data types, descriptions (if the specification or fragment defines them), accepted values (if the types are enums), and more.
 ** For security schemes, the type of scheme and the required authorization information.
 ** For `documentation` facets and fragments, the titles and content.
. The navigation icon: click this to show a table of contents that lets you navigate to the display for the item that you select.
 ** Click *Summary* to see the display for a specification.
 ** Click an endpoint's *Overview* link to see the display for that endpoint.
 ** Click a method to see the display for that method.
