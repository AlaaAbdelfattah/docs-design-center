The *Documentation* pane presents the content of an API specification or fragment in structured display that includes the documentation that you write in `description` and `documentation` facets, and that also includes text that the pane generates.

+
This image shows the summary page for the specification that is in the code editor. However, there are several different types of documentation that can appear in this location, depending on the item that you select in the table of contents.
+
 ** For an entire specification, the list of all of the endpoints in the specification and the methods for accessing them.
 ** For an endpoint, the URI for accessing it (using the base URI that is defined in the specification), a description of the endpoint (if the specification defines one), and a list of the HTTP methods that can access the endpoint.
 ** For an HTTP method, the URI for sending requests (using the base URI that is defined in the specification), a description of the method (if the specification defines one), and other information, depending on the type of method. For example, for GET methods there is a list of query parameters, while for DELETE methods there is a list of URI parameters. For all methods, the different responses defined in the specification are displayed.
 ** For types, their names, data types, descriptions (if the specification or fragment defines them), accepted values (if the types are enums), and more.
 ** For security schemes, the type of scheme and the required authorization information.
 ** For `documentation` facets and fragments, the titles and content.
