= Test Endpoints with a REST Client


== General Procedure
. In the code editor in API Designer, follow these steps:
.. Turn on the mocking service.
.. Open the documentation for the method that you want to simulate a call to.
.. Copy the URL that is at the top of the page.
. In the REST client, follow these steps:
.. Paste the URL into the client.
.. Specify values for required parameters, if there are any.
.. *Optional:* Add optional query parameters to test whether these are defined correctly.
.. *Optional:* Add optional headers (why? I mean headers other than the behavioral headers.)
.. *Optional:* For methods that send a request body, modify the body to trigger an error status code.
.. Send the request.

*Result:*
