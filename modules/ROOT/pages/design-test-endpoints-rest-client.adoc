= Test Endpoints with a REST Client

API Designer includes the *Try It* feature for testing endpoints in specifications that you are creating. However, you can use a separate REST client to test endpoints if you prefer to use your own test process.

== General Procedure
. In the code editor or the visual editor in API Designer, follow these steps:
.. Turn on the mocking service.
.. Open the documentation of the method that you want to simulate a call to.
.. Copy the URL that is at the top of the page.
. In a separate REST client, follow these steps:
.. Paste the URL into the client.
.. Specify values for required query parameters, if there are any.
.. *Optional:* Add one or more of the optional query parameters to test whether these are defined correctly.
.. Add any headers that you want to include in simulated calls. You can also test with headers that introduce delays into response times to simulate latency in a network, restrict the range of error status codes that can be returned, randomize the probability of receiving particular status codes, and more. You can even add a header that allows you to test endpoints in a specification that contains errors. See xref:apid-behavioral-headers.adoc[Behavioral Headers for Simulated Calls to REST Methods].

.. *Optional:* If you are testing a method that requires a request body, modify the request body so that the response to the request contain an error status code. You can click directly in the body and make changes to it before sending a request.
.. Send the request.
