When you add to a flow a card that represents a connector, Flow Designer requires that you specify how your Mule app can connect at runtime to the system that the connector is for.

For example, if you add a card that represents a database connector, Flow Designer opens the *Database Configuration* dialog. In that dialog, you can either select an existing connection to a database or create a connection.

A _connection_, in the sense that Flow Designer uses the term, is the set of information that a Mule app needs to connect to a system when the app is running. The connection is not an open channel of communication between the app and the system. It is the information that the app needs to use to open a channel of communication with the system. The rest of the content of this page and its subpages uses the term _connection_ in this sense.

<1> A connection in the sense that Flow Designer uses the term: the set of information that a Mule app needs to open a channel of communication with a system.
<2> A connection in a more common sense: an open channel of communication between two entities.


There are two types of connection:

Connections that can be used only within a single project::

Connections that can be shared with multiple projects and users::
