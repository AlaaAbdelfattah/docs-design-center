When a Mule application that you've developed in the Design environment is ready to go live, you can deploy it to another environment. The target environment must have enough vCores to accommodate the application; otherwise, deployment will fail.

As you deploy your application, you can change connector configurations and reconnection strategies. You need to do this if there are differences between the Design and target environments that would necessitate such changes.

== Procedure
. Click Deploy.

. Select the CloudHub environment to deploy the application to.
. Accept the default name for the deployed application or enter a new one.
. Edit the connection configurations to be compatible with the target environment.

== What to do next

You can go to Runtime Manager to manage the application. To get there from Flow Designer, click the three-dots icon to the left of the *Deploy* button and select *View in Runtime Manager*.

// April 5, 2019: I'm rewriting this topic today and can't find in our docs any info about securing apps. So, I'll comment this out for now:
// You can restrict access to the application in the target environment to specific users, if you do not want access available to the general public. To restrict access, your user ID must be an organization administrator in Anypoint Platform.
