All Mule applications that you create with Flow Designer are created in the Design environment. When a Mule application that you've created is ready to go live, you can deploy it to another environment, if your organization allows you to do so. The target environment must have enough vCores to accommodate the application; otherwise, deployment will fail.

As you deploy your application, you can change connector configurations and reconnection strategies. You need to do this if there are differences between the Design and target environments that would necessitate such changes.

After you deploy your application, the values for all of its properties are secured in Runtime Manager in the *Properties* section of the *Settings* page for the application. To see the list of an application's properties in Runtime Manager, click *Applications*, select the application, click *Settings*, and click *Properties*.

== To Deploy a Mule App from Flow Designer

<2> Select the option.

. Select the CloudHub environment to deploy the application to.
. Accept the default name for the deployed application or enter a new one.
. If you want to change the way that any of the connectors in your application connect to systems, click *Advanced* to see a list of the configurations that the connectors in your application are using. Select a configuration on the left to edit it.

== What to Do Next

You can go to Runtime Manager to manage the application. To get there from Flow Designer, click the three-dots icon to the left of the *Deploy* button and select *View in Runtime Manager*.
