When a Mule application that you've developed in the Design environment is ready to go live, you can deploy it to another environment. You must select an target environment, such as Production, that has been set up with vCores for deployment. You deploy an app to a specific environment for a number of reasons:

* Security
+
You can restrict the environment, as the organization administrator, to certain users.
* Traffic Management
+
You can change the connector configuration and reconnection strategy per environment. For example, you can connect to a different server to send requests based on the environment.

Be aware of the public exposure to your app as a consequence of deploying an app to a selected environment.

. Click Deploy.

. Set up the connection configurations of your project for the deployment environment.

Connector configuration fields are the same from one environment to another.

After deployment, you can go to Runtime Manager to manage the application. Click the options menu to the left of the *Deploy* button and select *View in Runtime Manager*.
