As you define and document an HTTP method for an endpoint, you can review the definition and documentation in the *Documentation* pane.

To open the documentation of a method, follow these steps:

. In the left-hand pane of the code editor, select the main file for your API specification, if it is not already selected.
. Follow either of these sets of steps:
* Option one:
+
.. Scroll down the summary page for the specification to find the endpoint that the method is defined for. If you do not see the summary page, click the *Documentation* tab at the bottom of the right-hand panel.
+
.. Click the method.

* Option two:
+
.. Click the navigation icon (image:apid-nav-icon.png[title="Navigation icon"]), which is just above the top-left corner of the *Documentation* pane.
+
.. In the *Endpoints* section of the table of contents, expand the endpoint that the method is defined for.
+
.. Click the entry for the method.

*Result:* The *Documentation* pane displays the documentation of the method, the top of which looks like this:

. The display name of the method, defined in the `displayName` facet for the method. If the specification does not define a display name, this space displays the type of the HTTP method that the documentation on the page is about.
. The URI for sending requests to the endpoint. If the mocking service is on, the URI displayed is generated by the mocking service. Otherwise, the URI is the base URI defined in the specification, with the name of the endpoint appended to it.

. The description that is specified in the method's `description` facet. You can write the description either in plain text or in GitHub-flavored Markdown.
. The *Try It* button for sending a request to a simulation of the endpoint that the method is defined for. Clicking this button replaces the content of the pane with controls for modifying and sending a request and for receiving a response.

A number of different collapsible sections also appear on the page.

== The *Code examples* Section

This section provides a sample command for `curl` for sending a request to the endpoint, as well as code that you can use to send a request from JavaScript, Python, C, and Java applications. Each sample uses the URI that appears at the top of the documentation of the method.

== The *Query parameters* Section

This section lists the parameters that act as a filter to narrow the range of data returned in response to the request.

. The name that is defined for the query parameter.
. The data type of the parameter. If the query parameter is required to be included in requests, the annotation `Required` appears next to the data type.
. The description that is given in the `description` facet for the query parameter.
. Generated text that displays (for number types) the default value, the minimum value, and the maximum value.
