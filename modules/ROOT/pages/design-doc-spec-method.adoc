As you define and document an HTTP method for an endpoint, you can review the definition and documentation in the *Documentation* pane.

To open the documentation of a method, follow these steps:

. In the left-hand pane of the code editor, select the main file for your API specification, if it is not already selected.
. Follow either of these sets of steps:
* Option one:
+
.. Scroll down the summary page for the specification to find the endpoint that the method is defined for. If you do not see the summary page, click the *Documentation* tab at the bottom of the right-hand panel.
+
.. Click the method.

* Option two:
+
.. Click the navigation icon (image:apid-nav-icon.png[title="Navigation icon"]), which is just above the top-left corner of the *Documentation* pane.
+
.. In the *Endpoints* section of the table of contents, expand the endpoint that the method is defined for.
+
.. Click the entry for the method.

*Result:* The *Documentation* pane displays the documentation of the method, the top of which looks like this:

. The display name of the method, defined in the `displayName` facet for the method. If the specification does not define a display name, this space displays the type of the HTTP method that the documentation on the page is about.
. The URI for sending requests to the endpoint. If the mocking service is on, the URI displayed is generated by the mocking service. Otherwise, the URI is the base URI defined in the specification, with the name of the endpoint appended to it.

. The description that is specified in the method's `description` facet. You can write the description either in plain text or in GitHub-flavored Markdown.
. The *Try It* button for sending a request to a simulation of the endpoint that the method is defined for. Clicking this button replaces the content of the pane with controls for modifying and sending a request and for receiving a response.

A number of different collapsible sections also appear on the page.

== The *Code examples* Section

This section provides a sample command for `curl` for sending a request to the endpoint, as well as code that you can use to send a request from JavaScript, Python, C, and Java applications. Each sample uses the URI that appears at the top of the documentation of the method.

== The *Query parameters* Section

This section lists the parameters that act as a filter to narrow the range of data returned in response to the request.

*The Numbered Parts of the Image*

. The name that is defined for the query parameter.
. The data type of the parameter. If the query parameter is required to be included in requests, the annotation `Required` appears next to the data type.
. The description that is given in the `description` facet for the query parameter.
. Generated text that displays (for number types) the default value, the minimum value, and the maximum value.

== The *Body* Section

This section describes the body that is defined for requests that require bodies and displays an example.

*The Numbered Parts of the Image*

1. The generated title of the section.
2. The media type of the response body for the selected status code.
3. The name of the type that is used as the response body.
4. The description that is given in the `description` facet for the type.
5. The example that is defined for the type. If the specification does not define an example and if the media type for examples is defined globally in the specification, then an example is generated. The values in generated examples are empty strings.

*The Numbered Parts of the Image*

. The name of the type.
. The data type of the type.
. The description that is defined in the `description` facet for the type.
. A generated indicator that appears when the specification defines the type as required. You do not need to add the indicator to the definition of the type in a specification.
. Examples that are defined for the type. If the specification does not define an example and if the media type for examples is defined globally in the specification, then an example is generated. For the type `item.paymentMethodType` in the image, two examples would be generated. The values in generated examples are empty strings.
. A line with generated text -- `Any of:` --and that shows which types are allowed in a union type. You do not need to add this text to a specification.
. A generated indicator that appears when a type is an `enum`. You do not need to add this text to a specification.
. A line with generated text -- `Enum values` -- and that shows the permitted values for an enum. You do not need to add this text to a specification.


== The *Response* Section

This section displays the response for each of the status codes that the API can return for calls to the HTTP method. For each status code, the body of the response is displayed. The details in each section include the media type of the response body, the name of the type being used for the response, an example of a response message, and descriptions of the types that are allowed in the response. Types that are required to be in the body are labelled `Required`.

2. The different status codes that the specification defines as possible responses to requests. Click a status code to view more information about it.
3. The description that is defined in the `description` facet for responses that use the specified status code. In this image, the description is for responses that the selected status code.

=== The *Body* Subsection

This layout of this section is identical to the layout of the *Body* section described above. The only difference between that section and the *Body* subsection is that the subsection displays the response body and its types, not the request body and its types.
