In Flow Designer, you create Mule applications as projects having one or more flows. A project contains the flows for one Mule application. A Mule application can have one or more flows. A flow consists of a sequence of _cards_, with each card representing a connector, core Mule Runtime component, API, or module. Each card receives an input, carries out a specific task, and then sends the output of that task to the next card in the flow. The final card in a flow is usually one that sends a notification that the Mule application has completed its task or that sends data.

To get started with Flow Designer by building an example Mule application, see xref:salesforce-to-twilio.adoc[Create Your First Mule Application with Flow Designer].


// Connectors:: These provide access to other applications, such as Salesforce, Slack, databases, Marketo, NetSuite, and many others. You configure connectors to tell Design Center where an application is located, how to connect to it, and which operation to perform with the application. Some connectors have operations that you can use as triggers that provide data that start flows. All connectors have operations that receive an input and perform an action, such as deleting rows from databases, sending emails, and more.

// Core Mule Runtime components represent functionality that is available in Mule Runtime. For example, you can use the Transform component to change the output of a card to a data type that the next card in a flow can accept. You can use the Choice component to choose which branch of a flow data should take, the choice being determined by the data itself.
