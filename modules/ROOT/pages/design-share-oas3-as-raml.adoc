You can share an OAS 3.0 API specification in Anypoint Exchange as a RAML API specification. Other developers can then download the RAML version for use in Anypoint Studio or third-party IDEs or for implementation with API Manager.

. Import the OAS 3.0 API specification into API Designer.
. Click the three dots next to the filename in the *Files* pane and select *Duplicate*.
. In the *Duplicate As* dialog, select *RAML*.
. Set the root file of the project to the RAML version of the API specification.
. Publish the project to Anypoint Exchange.

[NOTE]
====
If you want to share an OAS 3.0 specification in OAS 2, download your OAS 3.0 specification from API Designer as-is and then convert it to OAS 2.0 by using a tool such as APIMatic transformer.
