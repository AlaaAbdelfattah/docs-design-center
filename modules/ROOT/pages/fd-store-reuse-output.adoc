You can store the entire output of a card, rather than pass the output on to the next card in a flow. Normally, a card outputs data that is different from the data that it received as input. However, when you create a target variable, the card stores its output into that variable and passes to the next card the same message that it received as input.

.An ordinary flow contrasted with a flow in which a card outputs to a target variable

The first flow carries out these steps:

. Card A produces an output.
. Card B receives the entire output from Card A.

The second flow carries out these steps:

. Card A produces an output.
. Card B receives the entire output from Card A. It stores its own output in a variable, and then passes the variable and the output from Card A to Card C.
. Card C receives the output from Card A and the variable that contains the output of Card B.

You can create a target variable by using the *Target* and *Target Value* fields in a card.

WOnce defined, variables created with the target parameter are available for use within the flow, and you can access them like you access any other variable.


* Target (`target`): Name of the variable in which you want to store message data. Names can only include numbers, characters, and underscores. For example, hyphens are not allowed in the name.
* Target Value (`targetValue`): Value of the data to store in the target variable. By default, the value is the message payload (`payload`). The field accepts any value that a variable accepts: any supported data type, DataWeave expressions, the keywords `payload`, `attributes`, and `message`, but _not_ the keyword `vars`.



In this image, the Read operation of an FTP connector stores its payload in the variable `myVar`:

. The *Output* fields for the target variable are in the *Advanced* section of the component card, as is the case for all components that have these fields.
. The name `myVar` has been specified as the name of the target variable. There is no default name. The target variable stores the payload by default. You need to specify a target value only if you want to store something other than the full payload.

When you want to a variable, it will appear in cards later in the flow. To use the flow from the tutorial xref::salesforce-to-twilio.adoc["Create Your First Mule Application with Flow Designer"] as an example, the variable `OppDetails` is created early in the flow. The variable is still available in the Twilio card, which is the last card in the flow.

.The Twilio card, with the `OppDetails` variable highlighted

To use the variable in this Twilio card (or in any card where a variable is available, other than the Transform card), you would simply drag it into a field.

[NOTE]
====
Although `OppDetails` was created with a Set Variable card, it can be accessed and used in the same way as variables that are created though the use of the *Target* and *Target Value* fields in a card.
