= Store the Output of a Card, Rather than Pass the Output to the Next Card (Flow Designer)

When creating a flow in a Mule app, you might need to store data in a variable so that any component in the flow can use it. Non-void operations (such as the Read operation to the File connector) can store the message data that they return in a variable. Once defined, variables created with the target parameter are available for use within the flow, and you can access them like you access any other variable.

You often define variables through these parameters:

* Target (`target`): Name of the variable in which you want to store message data. Names can only include numbers, characters, and underscores. For example, hyphens are not allowed in the name.
* Target Value (`targetValue`): Value of the data to store in the target variable. By default, the value is the message payload (`payload`). The field accepts any value that a variable accepts: any supported data type, DataWeave expressions, the keywords `payload`, `attributes`, and `message`, but _not_ the keyword `vars`.

It is important to understand that setting a target variable changes the typical course of the message through the flow. Normally, an operation outputs a different message than it receives as input. However, when you set a variable from an operation, the operation outputs to the _next_ component in the flow the same message that it received as input. For example, assume you have a flow consisting of component A, followed by component B with a target value of `myMessage`, and then component C. In this case, component C will receive the same message that B received from A.

In this image, the Read operation of an FTP connector stores its payload in the variable `myVar`:

. The *Output* fields for the target variable are in the *Advanced* section of the component card, as is the case for all components that have these fields.
. The name `myVar` has been specified as the name of the target variable. There is no default name. The target variable stores the payload by default. You need to specify a target value only if you want to store something other than the full payload.

To access the content of `myVar` in another operation in the flow, you would use the expression `myVar.payload`.

For a list of the DataWeave functions that you can use in variable expressions, see "Core" in the DataWeave Function Reference. "Core" is linked to from the *See also* section at the end of this topic.
