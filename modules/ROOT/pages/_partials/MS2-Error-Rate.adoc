|===
|Other header used with MS2-Error-Rate
|Mocking service (MS) responds with an error code
|Mocking service does not respond with an error code

|MS2-Status-Code
|MS uses the error code specified in MS2-Status-Code.
|MS uses the non-error status code specified in MS2-Status-Code.

|MS2-Error-Level
|MS uses the first error status code that is defined for the method and that falls in the range specified for MS2-Error-Level.
|MS uses the first non-error status code that is defined for the method.

|MS2-Error-Level and MS2-Status-Code
|MS uses the first error status code that is defined for the method and that falls in the range specified for MS2-Error-Level.
|MS uses the first non-error status code that is specified in MS2-Status-Code.

|None
|MS uses the first error status code that is defined for the method.
