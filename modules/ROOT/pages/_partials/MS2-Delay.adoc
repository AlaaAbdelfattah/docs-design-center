You can specify a value for this header as an integer or as a range of integers. If you specify a range, the value must have the form `min-max`. For example, given the value `500-1000`, the request will take a random time between 500 and 1000 milliseconds.

[NOTE]
====
It is possible for the delay to be longer than a single integer value or the high end of a range, depending on the latency of your network.
