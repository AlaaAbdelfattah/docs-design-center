In the *Headers* section, add the header `MS2-Strict-Model-Validations` if your specification contains errors, but you want to test it anyway.

These are the possible values:

`false`:: Lets you can simulate a call to a method even when the API specification contains errors.

`true`:: The specification is validated before the call is simulated. If there is an error in the specification, the call fails.
