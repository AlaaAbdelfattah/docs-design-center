*The Numbered Parts of the Image*

. The name of the type.
. The data type of the type.
. The description that is defined in the `description` facet for the type.
. A generated indicator that appears when the specification defines the type as required. You do not need to add the indicator to the definition of the type in a specification.
. Examples that are defined for the type. If the specification does not define an example and if the media type for examples is defined globally in the specification, then an example is generated. For the type `item.paymentMethodType` in the image, two examples would be generated. The values in generated examples are empty strings.
. A line with generated text -- `Any of:` --and that shows which types are allowed in a union type. You do not need to add this text to a specification.
. A generated indicator that appears when a type is an `enum`. You do not need to add this text to a specification.
. A line with generated text -- `Enum values` -- and that shows the permitted values for an enum. You do not need to add this text to a specification.
