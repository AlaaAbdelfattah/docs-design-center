You can use behavioral headers to change the behavior of the mocking service.


.Use behavioral headers where you would normally specify other types of header in the API Console

MS2-Delay:: Indicates how many milliseconds the request should take to answer. You might want to use this header to simulate load on your server or latency in a network.
+
You can specify a value for this header as an integer number or as a range of integer numbers. If you specify a range, the value must have the form `min-max`. For example, given the value `500-1000`, the request will take a random time between 500 and 1000 milliseconds.
+
[NOTE]
====
It is possible for the delay to be longer than a single integer value or the high end of a range, depending on the latency of your network.

MS2-Error-Level:: Indicates which range of codes will be considered errors. You can specify one of the following three case-sensitive values:
+
* `REQUEST_ONLY`: Only 4XX codes are considered to be errors.
* `SERVER_ONLY`: Only 5XX codes are considered to be errors.
* `ALL`: Both 4XX and 5XX codes are considered to be error. This is the default value.

MS2-Error-Rate:: Indicates the probability of getting an error status code as a response. The value for this header must be a decimal number between 0 and 1.
+
This header works together with MS2-Status-Code and MS2-Error-Level, but not both at the same time.
+
* If you use this header together with MS2-Status-Code and the mocking service (based on the probability) determines that an error code should be returned, the mocking service uses the error code that is specified by MS2-Status-Code. Therefore, for MS2-Status-Code you must specify both a non-error code and an error code, with the two codes separated by a comma.
* If you use this header together with MS2-Error-Level and the mocking service (based on the probability) determines that an error code should be returned, the mocking service uses one of the error codes that is in the range specified by MS2-Error-Level. If the mocking service determines that a non-error code should be returned, it uses the first non-error code that is defined for the method.

MS2-Randomize:: When this header is sent as true, the mocking service auto-generates a payload response if no example is defined for the response.

MS2-Status-Code:: Specifies one or more status codes that the mocking service can choose from for the return message. Separate multiple status codes with commas. For example, you might want the mocking service to return your message for the 201 status code only; in this case, you would specify `201` for the value of this header. As another example, you might want the mocking service to return a 201 message, if there is no error, or a 401 status code, if there is an error; in this case, you would specify `201,401` for the value.
+
If you use this header and you do not provide a non-error status code, the mocking service throws an error if the API does not return an error. Also, if you use this header and you do not provide an error status code, the mocking service throws an error if the API returns an error.
+
If you do not use this header, the mocking service behaves as follows:
+
* If the API does not return an error, the mocking service returns the first non-error status code that is listed for the method.
* If the API does return an error, the mocking service returns the first error status code that is listed for the method.

MS2-Strict-Model-Validations:: When turning on the Mocking Service, the mock is created even when the API has errors. In this scenario, each time a request arrives, Mocking services try to validate the request and build the response according to the stored partial model. However, if MS2-Strict-Model-Validations is sent as true, Mocking Service will answer with the error found in the API.
