You can use behavioral headers to change the behavior of the mocking service.


.Use behavioral headers where you would normally specify other types of header in the API Console

MS2-Delay:: Indicates how many milliseconds the request should take to answer. You might want to use this header to simulate load on your server or latency in a network.
+
You can specify a value for this header as an integer number or as a range of integer numbers. If you specify a range, the value must have the form `min-max`. For example, given the value `500-1000`, the request will take a random time between 500 and 1000 milliseconds.
+
[NOTE]
====
It is possible for the delay to be longer than a single integer value or the high end of a range, depending on the latency of your network.
====

MS2-Error-Level:: Indicates which range of codes will be considered errors. You can specify one of the following three case-sensitive values:
+
* `REQUEST_ONLY`: Only 4XX codes are considered to be errors.
* `SERVER_ONLY`: Only 5XX codes are considered to be errors.
* `ALL`: Both 4XX and 5XX codes are considered to be error. This is the default value.

MS2-Error-Rate:: Indicates the probability of getting an error status code as a response. The value for this header must be a decimal number between 0 and 1.
+
This header works together with MS2-Status-Code and MS2-Error-Level. If the mocking service determines that an error code should be returned, it chooses the error code according to the codes filtered by MS2-Status-Code and the error level determined by MS2-Error-Level.
+
[NOTE]
====
The usage of this header requires to define at least one success and one error code (according to the error level), otherwise, Mocking Service will return an error
// What does this mean?
====

MS2-Randomize:: When this header is sent as true, the mocking service auto-generates a payload response if no example is defined for the response.

MS2-Status-Code:: Specifies one or more status codes that the mocking service can choose from for the return message. Separate multiple status codes with commas. For example, you might want the mocking service to return your message for the 201 status code only; in this case, you would specify `201` for the value of this header. As another example, you might want the mocking service to return a 201 message, if there is no error, or a 401 status code, if there is an error; in this case, you would specify `201,401` for the value.
+
You can even specify a range. For example, you might want the mocking service to return a 201 message, if there is no error, or a message for one of the status codes in the range 401 through 404, if there is an error; in this case, you would specify `201,401-404` as the value.
+
If you use this header and you do not provide a non-error status code, the mocking service throws an error if the API does not return an error. Also, if you use this header and you do not provide an error status code, the mocking service throws an error if the API returns an error.

MS2-Strict-Model-Validations:: When turning on the Mocking Service, the mock is created even when the API has errors. In this scenario, each time a request arrives, Mocking services try to validate the request and build the response according to the stored partial model. However, if MS2-Strict-Model-Validations is sent as true, Mocking Service will answer with the error found in the API.
