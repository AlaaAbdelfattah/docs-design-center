= Create an API Specification with the Visual API Editor

You can use Design Center's visual API editor to create RAML or OAS API specifications by populating language-neutral forms.

== Before you begin
Within Anypoint Platform, your user ID must be assigned the _Design Center Developer_ permission.

== About this task

As you populate the forms, the visual API editor generates two API specifications: one in RAML 1.0, the other in OAS 2.0 (in JSON). Both are visible in a read-only pane on the right of the screen. If at any time you want to edit the specification directly, click *Edit RAML*  or *Edit OAS*to switch to the API editor. After you switch, however, you cannot switch back to the visual API editor to continue creating the API specification.

== Procedure
. Create a project from the *Projects* page in Design Center by clicking *Create* and selecting *API Specification*.
. In the *New API Specification* dialog, name your project and select the option *Try API designer's visual editing capabilities* to use the visual API editor.
+
_Result:_
+
The visual API editor opens. The editor is divided into three panels:
+
* The left panel lists the resources and data types that you create in the specification.
* The middle panel presents the forms in which you specify the properties of the components of the specification.
* The right panel displays the RAML Viewer and the OAS Viewer. This panel also lets you run the mocking service.
. Fill in the fields of the editor to define the features that you want in your specification. As you do so, both the RAML Viewer and the OAS Viewer show the content of the specification that you are creating.
+
As you make progress, you can run the mocking service to simulate calls to your API specification. For more information, view the topic "Simulate Calls to an API", which is listed in the *See Also* section at the end of this topic.

== What to do next


// After you are satisfied with your API specification, you can publish it to Exchange in RAML or OAS. If you want to publish it both in RAML and in OAS, publish it twice, the second time changing the name. For example, the first time you publish the specification, you might choose to publish in RAML and specify the name as `myAPI (RAML 1.0)`; the second time, you would choose to publish in OAS and could specify the name `myAPI (OAS 2.0 JSON)`.
After you are satisfied with your API specification, you can publish it to Exchange in RAML. To publish, click the icon that is in the top-right corner of the visual API editor to open the *Publish API specification to Exchange* dialog. The icon looks like this:
