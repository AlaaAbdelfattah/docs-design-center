= Create a DataWeave Expression in a Text Field

If you know DataWeave, you can create expressions in plain text fields with the help of an editor.

At the top of the list appears an entry named "Custom Expression". You can click it and drop it into a text field if you want to compose a DataWeave expression within that field.

== Example: Creating a complex expression

Additionally, you can drag and drop the *Custom Expression* block to create more complex expressions.

Assume you want to log a greeting for both of users. Since your _candidates_ variable is an array, DataWeave won't be able to concatenate it next to a _Hello_ string. You need to use a custom expression to be able to log a proper greeting for both your candidates.

. Open a logger card, and drag the *Custom Expression* block.

. Double-click on it to open the custom expression field, and type the following DataWeave expression:
+
[source,DataWeave,linenums]
----
"Hello " ++ (joinBy(vars.candidates, ' and '))
----
. Click *OK*.

Note that the field automatically understood the concatenation between your _Hello_ and the rest of your custom expression.
