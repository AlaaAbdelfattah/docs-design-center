= Create a DataWeave Expression in a Text Field

If you know DataWeave, you can create expressions in plain text fields with the help of an editor.

== About this task

Every card in a flow presents a list on its right side. The first entry in the list is labelled `Custom Expression`. (Other entries in the list appear when a card is preceded by at least one other card. However, for this task, you need only the `Custom Expression` entry.)

You can click the `Custom Expression` entry and drop it into a text field if you want to compose a DataWeave expression within that field.

== Procedure

. Open the card in which you want to add a DataWeave expression to a plain text field.
. Click on `Custom Expression` in the list on the right side of the card and drag it into the text field.
. Compose your expression with the help of the right side of the editor.
+
* Click a payload element, attribute, or variable to add it to the expression.
+
* Click a function to add it to the expression.
