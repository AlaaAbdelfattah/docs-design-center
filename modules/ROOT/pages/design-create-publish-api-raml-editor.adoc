You can use Design Centerâ€™s API editor create API specifications directly in RAML 0.8, RAML 1.0, or OAS 2.0 (either in JSON or YAML).

== Before you begin
Within Anypoint Platform, your user ID must be assigned the _Design Center Developer_ permission.

== Procedure
. On the *Projects* page in Design Center, click *Create* and select *API Specification*.
. In the *New API Specification* dialog, name your project and select the option *Start with API Designer* to use the API editor.
+
_Result:_ The API editor opens. The editor is divided into three panels:
+
* The left panel lists the files in your project. By default, the editor creates a `.raml` file that has the same name as the project. You can change the name and extension of this file by right-clicking the three dots to the right of the name and selecting Rename.
+
[TIP]
====

You can create more than one API specification or related file in a single project. Click the plus sign in the Files panel to create a new file or click the dots that are next to the plus sign to import a file.

====
* The central panel displays the editor in which you create the API specification. Appearing in the editor when you create a project or start a new API specification are the first two lines of a valid RAML 1.0 file. You can change these lines if you want to use RAML 0.8 or OAS 2.0 (either JSON or YAML).
* The right panel lists the types and resources that are in the API specification that is in the central panel.

. Draft your API specification.
+
While you are working in the editor, you can use a large number of commands to navigate through and manipulate the content of your specification. Press F1 at any time to see a list of them. This list also displays keyboard shortcuts for most of the commands.
+
You can also perform these tasks:
+
Import files and API fragments into your project:: You can import files, either separately or bundled together in .zip files. The files can be RAML 1.0 files, JSON files, or OpenAPI Specification (OAS) 2.0 files (either JSON or YAML). The files can be on your computer or you can specify a URL for them if they are located online.
+
For more information about importing files and steps for how to import them, see "Import Files into an API Project", which is linked to from the *See also* section at the end of this topic.
+
For information about adding API fragments to your project, see "Add a RAML API Fragment to an API-Specification Project as a Dependency", which is linked to from the *See also* section at the end of this topic.
+
Simulate calls to your API:: Even while you are drafting an API specification, you can simulate calls to endpoints for which you have specified
+
* An HTTP status code the API returns, if successful
* An example of data the actual implementation would return
+
For more information, view the topic "Simulate Calls to an API", which is linked to from the *See also* section at the end of this topic.

Export your API project or specification:: At any time, you can export your project as a `.zip` file. 

== What to do next
After you are satisfied with your specification, you can publish it to Anypoint Exchange. Click the icon that is in the top-right corner of the API editor to open the *Publish API Specification to Exchange* dialog. The icon looks like this
