You can delete an API-specification project or an API-fragment project.

[NOTE]
====
If you have already published a project, deleting it in API Designer does not delete it from Anypoint Exchange.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The deletion of a project is final. Deleting a project does _not_ move it to a *Trash* folder from which you can restore the project if you change you mind.
====
