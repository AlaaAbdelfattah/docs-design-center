As you define and document a DELETE method for an endpoint, you can review the definition and documentation in the *Documentation* pane.

To open the documentation of a method, follow these steps:

. In the left-hand pane of the code editor, select the main file for your API specification, if it is not already selected.
. Follow either of these sets of steps:
* Option one:
+
.. Scroll down the summary page for the specification to find the endpoint that the method is defined for. If you do not see the summary page, click the *Documentation* tab at the bottom of the right-hand panel.
+
.. Click the method.

* Option two:
+
.. Click the navigation icon (image:apid-nav-icon.png[title="Navigation icon"]), which is just above the top-left corner of the *Documentation* pane.
+
.. In the *Endpoints* section of the table of contents, expand the endpoint that the method is defined for.
+
.. Click the entry for the method.

*Result:* The *Documentation* pane displays the documentation of the method, which looks like this:

. The name of the type.
. The data type of the type.
. A generated label that appears when the specification defines a type as required.
. The description that is defined in the description facet for the type.
. A generated indicator that appears when a type is an enum, as well as a line with generated text — Enum values — and that shows the permitted values for an enum.
