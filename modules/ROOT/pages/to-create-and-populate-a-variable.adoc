You can use a Set Variable card to create a variable that stores data from the output of a card. You can then reuse that data in a later card by using the variable.

.An ordinary flow contrasted with a flow in which a Set Variable card is used

The first flow carries out these steps:

. Card A produces an output.
. Card B receives the entire output from Card A.

The second flow carries out these steps:

. Card A produces an output.
. The Set Variable card stores all or part of the output from Card A in a variable.
. Card B receives the entire set of data from Card A (payload and attributes) and the variable. It outputs its own set of data and the variable. The output from Card A, except for the part that was stored in the variable, is no longer part of the flow
. Card C receives the entire set of data from Card B and the variable.

For example, in the tutorial xref::salesforce-to-twilio.adoc["Create Your First Mule Application with Flow Designer"], you used a Set Variable card after the trigger card, so that you could save the trigger card's payload. The reason was that you needed to use information from the payload after using the Choice router, and none of the three possible outputs from the Choice router would preserve that information.

.The Set Variable card from the tutorial

You used the variable, which you named `OppDetails`, in the Transform card that followed the Choice router.

However, if you had wanted to use `OppDetails` later in the flow, it was still available, as you can see here in the Twilio card, which was the last card in the flow.

.The Twilio card, with the `OppDetails` variable highlighted

To use the variable in this Twilio card (or in any card where a variable is available, other than the Transform card), you would simply drag it into a field.

If you believe that you no longer need to use a variable after using it one or more times, you can add the Remove Variable card after the card in which the variable is last used.

== Procedure

. Click the plus icon that follows the card that outputs the data you want to store and reuse.
. Add a Set Variable card.
. Specify a name for the variable. Names can include only numbers, characters, and underscores.
. Specify a value for the variable.
* If you want to specify a string value, ensure that the *f(x)* button appears to the right of the *Value* field. The presence of this button means that the field is in string mode, not function mode. You can type directly into the *Value* field and do not need to use quotation marks, unless you are specifying a string within a string.

* If you want to specify a DataWeave expression, ensure that `f(x)` appears in the right side of the *Value* field. The presence of `f(x)` means that the field is in expression mode. Clicking in the field opens the *Custom Expression* dialog, where you can compose an expression with the help of the *Add data* and *Add functions* panes on the right.

[NOTE]
====
For the *Add data* pane to appear, at least one of the previous cards must output a data type that is other than `Default`.

For documentation about the DataWeave functions that are listed in the *Add functions* pane, see "xref:4.1@mule-runtime::dw-core.adoc[Core]" in the DataWeave Function Reference.

====
+
*Example based on the screenshot of the Custom Expression window:* If you wanted to save the payload's error message into a variable, you would click `error_message`. The *Expression* field would then contain the expression `error_message`. You would then click *OK*.
+
Or you could also choose to type in a value. For example, if you wanted to store the entire payload in a variable, you could type `payload` in the *Custom Expression* field.
. Click *OK* in the *Custom Expression* dialog and then click the canvas to close the card.

== Examples

To store the payload from the previous card, set the value of the variable to `payload`.

To store the attributes from the previous card, set the value of the variable to `attributes`.

To store the entire set of data at the current point in a flow, set the value of the variable to `message`.

To store a Boolean value, set the value of the variable to `true` or `false`.
