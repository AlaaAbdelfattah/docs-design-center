The Transform card contains numerous features to make it easy for you to map data.

== The static features of the Transform card

The Transform card has four sections: *Configuration*, *Input*, *Output*, and *Notes*. The last three sections are common to all cards. While the *Notes* section can be very useful for explaining the work you have done in the Transform card or writing instructions to other people who might use your application as a template, you do not use the *Input* and *Output* sections in this card.

. The card's type and name. As with other cards, you can rename the card from the default name `DataWeave` to any name that suits your purposes.

. This banner indicates whether Flow Designer has mapping suggestions for you. When it does, the banner looks like this:
+

+
See "xref::get-mapping-recommendations.adoc[Get a Recommendation for Mapping Data Types for a Transformation]" to learn when Flow Designer can make mapping suggestions for you.

. The *Input* pane shows the output from the previous card. The Transform card displays the three parts of the output: the payload, attributes, and variables. If the payload is not a simple data type, you might need to specify the data type that it uses. You might need to do the same for attributes, variables, or both.
+
Supported simple data types:: Boolean, Date, DateTime, Integer, Number, String

Other supported data types:: CSV, JSON, Object, XML
+
You can specify the data type by clicking the three dots to the right of `payload` or `vars` to open the *Data Type Actions* menu.
+
.The menu for setting the data type for a payload, attributes, and variables in the *Input* pane

+
You can create the data type that you need or select it if you created it earlier. See "xref::about-data-types.adoc[Data Types]" to learn more.

. Here you can switch between sections of the Transform card by clicking their names. (The name of the *Notes* section is not pictured.)

. Here you can switch between the panes of the *Configuration* section. In the image, the *Mappings* pane is selected and open.

. The *Preview* pane shows a preview of the output of the Transform card. Before a preview can appear, you must map the input of the Transform card to the output. When no preview is yet available, the pane looks like this:

== The *Mappings* pane

. The *Output* pane displays the elements that will be in the payload of the output of the Transform card and passed to the next card in the flow. If the Flow Designer is unable to detect the data structure that is required by the next card in the flow, you can specify the data type to use for the payload.

Setting expressions for values in the output pane.

. This area shows which elements of the input to the Transform card are mapped to which elements of the output. To map elements together, you can click an element of the input and drag it to an element of the output. An alternative is to create a DataWeave script that maps elements. You can do this in the *Script* pane.
