// 8/23/19: I very much need to see what an OAS spec looks like in APIC. The OAS specs that Kieran pointed me to on Google Drive are all 3.0.0, and APID does not support that version. In Slack on #api-designer-eng, I asked for OAS specs that APID supports: https://mulesoft.slack.com/archives/G1UVDDN8P/p1566585045000100?thread_ts=1565714204.001400&cid=G1UVDDN8P
// I realized again today that I need OAS specs again because I was trying to describe how (at least, in RAML) types that are defined in fragments that are included in a spec with the `uses` facet are displayed in the TOC for the full spec, as well as in the TOCs for the fragments. But I realized I was describing only the behavior for RAML, not for OAS.

As you write an API specification in API Designer's code editor, you can add documentation to it, so that, after you publish the specification, other developers can learn about them. As you add your documentation in either plain text or in GitHub-flavored Markdown, you can review it in the right panel of the code editor to see how it is rendered, ensure that it is rendered correctly, and ensure that it says what you want it to say.
