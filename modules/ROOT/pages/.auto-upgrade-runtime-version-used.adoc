= Automatic Upgrades of Mule-App Projects to the Latest Mule Runtime

After a new version of Mule runtime is released, opening an existing Mule-app project causes the application to use that new version. The application is upgraded immediately, Design Center then restarting it in the Design environment only. If Design Center is unable to upgrade an application, the application is not restarted.

This process ensures that Mule applications are always using the latest version of Mule Runtime.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The upgrade might require you to update the connectors that are used in the application. If so, you cannot redeploy the application until you update the connectors.

For the steps required to update a connector, see xref:manage-dependency-versions-design-center.adoc[Update Dependencies in a Mule-Application Project (Design Center)].
