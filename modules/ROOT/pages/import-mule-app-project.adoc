== Before you begin

* If you plan to import a Mule application that was exported from Anypoint Studio, ensure that, when it was exported, these options were selected:

image::project-export-studio-options.png[]

image::project-export-studio-options-2.png[]

== Procedure

. On the Project page of Design Center, click the *Create* button and select *Import Application*.
. Specify a name to give to the imported project.
. Browse your filesystem for the `.jar` file that contains the project. Both Design Center and Studio export Mule-application projects in `.jar` files.
. Click *Import*.

== Result

The imported project is opened and includes all of its flows, reusable configurations, and data types.
