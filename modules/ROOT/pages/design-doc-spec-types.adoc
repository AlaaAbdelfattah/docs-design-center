Each type that is defined in a specification or in an external library that is imported by the `uses` facet (RAML) has its own documentation.

To open the documentation of a type, follow these steps:

. In the left-hand pane of the code editor, select the main file for your API specification, if it is not already selected.
. Follow either of these sets of steps:
. Click the navigation icon (image:apid-nav-icon.png[title="Navigation icon"]), which is just above the top-left corner of the *Documentation* pane.
. In the *Types* section of the table of contents, click the entry for the type.

*Result:* The *Documentation* pane displays the documentation of the type.

== Documentation of a Simple Type

Suppose that you defined this simple type in a specification written in RAML:

----
ProductCharacteristic:
  type: object
  description: |
    characteristic of a product
  properties:
    code:
      type: string
    name:
      type: string
    description:
      type: string
----

The documentation of this simple type looks like this:

.The documentation of a simple type
image::apid-doc-simple-type.png[]

*The Numbered Parts of the Image*

. The name of the type
. The value of the `description` facet for the type
. The name of a property of the type
. The data type of the property
. A label that is generated if the specification defines the type as required

== Other Examples

Here is another simple type in RAML, this one with examples, together with its definition in the specification.

Finally, here is a RAML example that shows how properties that can take null values are displayed and how enums are displayed.
