Each type that is defined in a specification or in an external library that is imported by the `uses` facet (RAML) has its own page. At the top of the page is the name of the type and its description, if the specification defines a description.

Next appears an example of the type. If the specification does not define an example, and if the specification defines a media type globally, then the *Documentation* pane generates an example. The values in the example are all empty strings. You can copy examples to use them in applications that will call the API.

After the example, the elements of the type are listed and described. Any elements that are required to be in the type are labelled `Required`.
