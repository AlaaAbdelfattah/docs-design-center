Each type that is defined in a specification or in an external library that is imported by the `uses` facet (RAML) has its own documentation.

To open the documentation of a type, follow these steps:

. In the left-hand pane of the code editor, select the main file for your API specification, if it is not already selected.
. Follow either of these sets of steps:
. Click the navigation icon (image:apid-nav-icon.png[title="Navigation icon"]), which is just above the top-left corner of the *Documentation* pane.
. In the *Types* section of the table of contents, click the entry for the type.

*Result:* The *Documentation* pane displays the documentation of the type.

The documentation of a simple type might look like this:

. The name of the type
. The value of the `description` facet for the type
. The name of a property of the type
. The data type of the property
. A label that is generated if the specification defines the type as required
